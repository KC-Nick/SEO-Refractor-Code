# CSS Starter Code Refracture Project

I have edited the HTML and CSS to reflect a more accessible and structured code. I have included multiple alt descriptions of images for screen readers and replaced the div elements to be more descriptive.

## Description

I was asked by a client to work on their website so that it had more accessible HTML Semantics; it had all the headers fall into sequential order; it had a more descriptive and informing title; it followed a structure of logic, outside of styling and positioning; and all images were given descriptive alt text so that they were accessible to screen readers. Along with this, I have included notes in the CSS to further explain these things.
